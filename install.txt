// Side note: THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENTATION IS A 'MUST READ' !

// Introduction

The additional customers fields MOD allows you to create, delete, activate/de-activate your created fields - 
on wizard basis with simply one or two clicks.

So far, Zen-Cart will be the most recognized (if not uniquely) for this type of easy functionality. As it may have noticed already,
several thousands of users were waiting for this moment to come. The cure has finally been discovered !

// Features

- No more technical knowledge for adding additional customers fields into the TABLE_CUSTOMERS table.
- Universal languages compatible.

- Admin/customers.php file now supports PHP array grouped table names
  (see: admin/includes/languages/english/extra_definitions/additional_customers_fields.php file for more info on this).

- Auto-checked option fields selection - implemented.
- Javascript listing appearance when selecting SQL fields type, size and more (note: the fields and types are based from your includes/zc_install/sql/mysql_zencart.sql file).
- Auto-verification files, constructor and functions implemented as it checks each times you execute the 'Add Customers Fields' page (under the admin's header bar).
- Reset listing table link (only listing table - not your core table).
- Create additional customers fields - wizard basis.
- MessageStack messages implemented for each negative actions.
- Set activation of each fields by a single click from the 'Add Customers Fields' 's main page.
- Test for each files under admin/customers.php page before officially publishing your created fields to your customer's form - implemented.
  Note: If you already added customers fields manually into the admin/customers.php file, 
- Possibility to set URL fields (Remote or Local links).

  you have two options:

  1 - Remove these fields and use these names under the admin's extra definitions folder.
  2 - Keep your manual fields there but as long as you do NOT add these definitions under the admin's extra definitions folder (considering you already made manual additions to admin/customers.php file in the past).

  However, I'd personally recommend option 1 since, once you have removed these manual fields, you can add them into the arrays 'the way you want them
  to be' (length fields included now - updated on May 22 2008 - starting on v3.0 release).

- Delete each additional customers fields without affecting your custom templates - implemented.
- Auto-update of each additional customers fields with core fields without affecting your current readings under the TABLE_CUSTOMERS table - implemented.
- Create account page process - additional customers fields updated into the TABLE_CUSTOMERS table without affecting any previous readings - implemented.

// Installation

Simply upload all the files, from this ZIP package, - except for the following ones:

- admin/customers.php file.
- includes/modules/<your_template>/create_account.php file.
- includes/modules/pages/account_edit/header_php.php file.
- includes/templates/<your_template>/templates/tpl_account_edit_default.php file.
- includes/templates/<your_template>/templates/tpl_modules_create_account.php file.
- includes/classes/order.php file.
- includes/auto_loaders/config.core.php file.

Use a comparing tool software for the listed files above.

Note: All paragraphs that needs to be added to your files, from the listed files above, are identified, with this title MOD name, from the beginning to the end.

Go to your admin - > tools - > Install SQL Patches - then add the following content to your database (make a backup first in case if fails):

CREATE TABLE customers_additional (
  field_id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  field_name varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  field_status char(2) NOT NULL default '',
  PRIMARY KEY (field_id)
) ENGINE=MyISAM;

// How it works . . .

Once all the files has been uploaded successfully + compared from the listed files above with yours:

- Execute this MOD from your admin's header bar menu (customers -> Add Customers Fields). Make sure the diagnostic reports no error(s).
- Go to your admin - > Customers's core page. Then, open your FTP / cPanel access, 
  go to your admin/includes/languages/english/extra_definitions/additional_customers_fields.php file to follow the rest of the instructions.

- Once followed, refresh your Customers's core page and see if your title(s) and element(s) are filled out in correctly into the arrays.
- Test your fields.
- Edit your customized template with the created field(s) by following the example from this package - on how to do so.
- Go back to your customer's core page, fill out some readings.
- Check again, on the same page, to see if your readings were being entered correctly.
- Go back to your customers - > Add customers fields page link and activate the field(s) - and VOILA !

Update for v2.0 release: Please read the changelog documentation for more details on how the latest release works.

// Basic questions:

- What if I decide to reset my listing tables, will my additional fields, from my TABLE_CUSTOMERS table be affected as well ?
No and no. If you decide to re-add them into your list, mySQL could probably mention that you have duplicated fields.

- Do I need to modify the listing table manually over PHPMYADMIN ?
Absolutely not. All (or most) modifications can be done from the admin's end.

- How would I know if these procedures are safe ?
For each fields creation you will make, you'll be notified as well as recommended to do some operations before these actions are being officially sent to the server.
