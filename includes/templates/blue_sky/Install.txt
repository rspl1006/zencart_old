Very easy to install. Just add it to yout templates folder.
Be sure to go into your admin and turn on/reset your sideboxes in your layout controller.

Blue is one of my favorite colors so I thought I would spice zencart up a bit with a nice blue theme. I chanced some of the text sizes in the css file and the sidebox border colors.
